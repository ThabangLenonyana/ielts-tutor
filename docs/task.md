Real-Time Conversational Practice with IELTS Speaking Test Simulation
Objective:
Create a tool that simulates a real-time IELTS Speaking Test. It should allow users to practice speaking English and provide performance assessments based on IELTS criteria, such as fluency, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

Key Requirements:
Standalone Functionality:
The tool should work independently, without needing platforms like ChatGPT.
Use an external LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) or deploy a custom LLM.
Real-Time Conversation:
Integrate a Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe) for real-time transcription.
Use a conversational AI to simulate an IELTS examinerâ€™s responses.
Ensure minimal delay for a smooth, natural conversation.
IELTS Scoring Simulation: Implement the following:
Fluency & Coherence: Timing, pauses, and logical flow.
Lexical Resource: Vocabulary usage and suggestions.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: Sentence structure and grammar.
Bonus: Pronunciation feedback via phoneme-level analysis.
Session Types:
Practice Mode: Instant feedback for each response.
Test Mode: Full IELTS Speaking Test with 3 sections:
Part 1: Introduction
Part 2: Long Turn (Cue Card Activity)
Part 3: Two-Way Discussion
Provide feedback at the end of the session.
5 Custom Feedback:

Corrected sentences, pronunciation tips, vocabulary suggestions.
Option to download a PDF report with scores and improvement recommendations.
Optional Enhancements:
Customizable LLM selection (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
Progress tracking over time.
Multi-language support for feedback.
Cue card visuals for enhanced user experience.
Deliverables:
Standalone Project:
A fully functional tool that can be run locally or via a hosted link (cloud or containerized solution like Docker).
Provide setup instructions if running locally.
